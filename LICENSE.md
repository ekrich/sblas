### Origin of this work

This project brings BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) to Scala Native.
The code is written in Scala to interface with the C library interface to BLAS
known as CBLAS. As such this is a derivative work so the applicable licenses
follow to attribute to the original work as best as can be determined.

### License notice for BLAS

The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package. It is available from
netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be included in
commercial software packages (and has been). We only ask that proper credit
be given to the authors.

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do
ask the following:

- If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the
name of the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

- We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a modification
is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person who modified the
routine to provide support.
